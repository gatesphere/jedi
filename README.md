# jedi Programming Language 

Copyright (c) 2012, Jacob Peck, All Rights Reserved.

## Overview

jedi is a small, experimental language focused on two fundamental concepts: immutable state and dataflow.  jedi is not a dataflow language (such as [Mana](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/Mana)), nor is it a functional language (such as [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)).  jedi is a representational language founded upon a few featured data types: disturbances and contemplations, which map directly to edges and states of a finite state machine model of computation.


## Why jedi?  

Because I want to try my hand at creating something new and unique.  I don't expect this language to gain much (if any) traction whatsoever, and I have absolutely no experience in creating a language.  But what better place to learn than to try?

## Requirements

Jedi is being written in [Io](http://www.iolanguage.com/), and targeting the Io Virtual Machine.  Future implementations may target [Caribou](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/caribou).
